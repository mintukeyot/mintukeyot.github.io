                                 A Story On Rice Planting and Learning About Life 
“Is this your first time planting rice?” said our host Mr Pan, a farmer from the rural outskirts of The grey-haired farmer, in his sixties, found it hard to comprehend how anyone could not have planted rice before. We giggled amusingly, slipped off our sandals and dug our feet into the wet, soggy and very soft earth. The soil wrapped its way around our toes and reached above our ankles. It took a while for us to get used to it – but soon enough we were frolicking in the soil, amidst the crawling snails and leaping frogs.
”First you pick stall and stuff it deep into the mud. It’s easy!” Mr Pan and his wife each grabbed a handful of rice seedlings and demonstrated to us where and how deep each seedling should go. They had no idea why anyone would come and learn how to plant rice from them, but they were happy anyhow to have us here as their guests. With our backs bent, we burrowed the seedlings into the mud, and listened as Pan told us one story after another about his life growing up in this village.
